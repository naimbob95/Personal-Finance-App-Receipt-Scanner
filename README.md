# Personal Receipt Scanner

A NestJS-based personal finance application with receipt scanning functionality powered by OpenRouter's AI models.

## Features

- Upload and scan receipts using OpenRouter's free AI models
- Extract vendor name, transaction date, total amount, and individual items with prices
- Store and manage receipt data
- RESTful API for CRUD operations

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas URI)
- OpenRouter API key (free tier available)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/finance-app
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   UPLOAD_DIRECTORY=./uploads
   ```
4. Replace `your_openrouter_api_key` with your actual OpenRouter API key

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```
npm run start:dev
```

### Production Mode
```
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## API Endpoints

### Receipts

- `GET /api/receipts` - Get all receipts
- `GET /api/receipts/:id` - Get a receipt by ID
- `POST /api/receipts` - Create a new receipt
- `PUT /api/receipts/:id` - Update a receipt
- `DELETE /api/receipts/:id` - Delete a receipt
- `POST /api/receipts/scan` - Upload and scan a receipt image

### API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. After starting the application, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/docs
```

This provides a user-friendly interface to:
- Explore available endpoints
- Read API documentation
- Test API endpoints directly from the browser
- View request/response schemas

## Scanning Receipts

To scan a receipt:

1. Send a POST request to `/api/receipts/scan`
2. Include a form-data field named `receipt` with the receipt image file
3. The API will return the extracted receipt data after processing

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/receipts/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "receipt=@path/to/receipt/image.jpg"
```

## Notes

- This application uses a demo user ID for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should implement proper authentication and user management.
- Receipt images are stored in the `uploads` directory.
- The free OpenRouter model used is `anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307`. You can change this in the `receipts.service.ts` file if needed.
